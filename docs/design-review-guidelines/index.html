If you think the design is good enough and should be done add an “LGTM” to the table cell next to your name.<p>If you have blocking concerns or remarks, please add “Not LGTM, because &lt;reason>” into the table cell next to your name. Be prepared to get asked for another round of review.<h3 id=how-does-this-work-together-with-the-blink-intents-process%3F>How does this work together with the Blink Intents process? <a href=#how-does-this-work-together-with-the-blink-intents-process%3F class=bookmark>#</a></h3><p>The V8 Design Review Guidelines complement <a href=/docs/feature-launch-process>V8’s Blink Intent+Errata process</a>. If you are launching a new WebAssembly or JavaScript language feature, please follow V8’s Blink Intent+Errata process and the V8 Design Review Guidelines. It likely makes sense to have all the LGTMs gathered at the point in time you would send an Intent to Implement.</main><footer id=footer><div><nav><a href=https://v8.dev/docs/design-review-guidelines>原文</a> · <a href=/logo/ >商标</a> · <a href=/terms/ >条款</a> · <a href=https://policies.google.com/privacy/ >隐私</a> · <a href=https://twitter.com/v8js rel="me nofollow">Twitter</a> · <a href=https://github.com/justjavac/v8.js.cn/tree/master/./src/docs/design-review-guidelines.md rel=nofollow>在 GitHub 编辑此页面</a></nav><dark-mode-toggle dark="Light Theme" light="Dark Theme" permanent></dark-mode-toggle></div><p><small>如无特殊说明，此 V8 项目中使用到的所有示例代码均基于 <a href=https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/master/LICENSE>V8's BSD-style license</a> 发布。页面中的文字内容采用 <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ >the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License</a> 进行许可。更详细的信息可以在 <a href=/terms#site-policies>站点策略</a> 中找到。</small></footer><script src=/_js/dark-mode-toggle.mjs type=module></script><script src=/_js/main.mjs type=module></script><script src=/_js/legacy.js nomodule></script>
